But we had also identified a gap in the market; for Aussie made, 100% recycled toilet paper that did some good in the world. </p> <p class="we-started-about1"></p> <p class="we-started-about1"> Most toilet rolls sold in Australia are made overseas. But our products are proudly made in Australia, in partnership with a small local manufacturing business. Why? Well because Australia is pretty awesome. We've got Uluru, the Blue Mountains, Ash Barty... and now, some of the finest, softest, toilet rolls ever made. </p> <p class="we-started-about1"></p> <p class="we-started-about1"> It was important to us to keep our business local, meaning more Aussies jobs and support for Aussie families. And when our manufacturers are also our neighbours, we can meet down the pub for a beer. Better and better. </p> </div> <div class="approximately-200000-dogs-container1"> <p class="we-started-about1"> Approximately 200,000 dogs are admitted to shelters and municipal rescue facilities each year in Australia. And even though the folks at all the amazing shelters are pretty great, they can’t do it alone. They succeed because of generous supporters whose time and money help them care for, treat, protect, and rehome animals across the state. </p> <p class="we-started-about1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="we-started-about1"> We donate 50% of all our profits to organisations helping animals in need because it feels damn good to support their work. And every time you buy a loo roll from us, you’re helping an animal too. </p> </div> <div class="at-about-a4"> At About A Dog, we’re a small, Sydney-based bum roll producer. We’ve got a dedicated team of people who live and breathe toilet paper (not literally), and who care about making sure every-bum gets the best, softest choice of recycled loo rolls. </div> <b class="at-about-a5">At About A Dog, we’re just a few mates, with a warehouse and a desire for soft TP.</b> <div class="shop-now-wrapper20"> <div class="shop-now23">shop now</div> </div> <div class="were-a-new-container21"> <p class="we-started-about1"> We’re a new company.
